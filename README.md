The DriverPass project was aimed at developing a system to help students prepare for their driving tests. The client required an online platform that would provide both practice exams and the ability to schedule on-road driving lessons. The system needed to support different user roles, including customers, secretaries, and IT administrators, and it was essential for users to be able to perform tasks such as scheduling lessons, tracking user activity, and generating reports.

One thing I believe I did particularly well was creating the UML diagrams that visually represented the different workflows in the system, such as the use case and activity diagrams. These diagrams helped clarify the overall functionality of the system and ensured that both the technical and non-technical stakeholders had a clear understanding of how the system would operate. Additionally, I focused on the technical requirements to ensure the system would be scalable and secure, which was a priority for the client

If I had to revise one part of my work, I would focus on the functional requirements section in the business requirements document. While I made sure to include all the necessary functionalities, I believe this section could have been expanded further by including more detailed edge cases and user scenarios, such as handling appointment rescheduling conflicts. Improving the specificity in this area would make the system even more stable.

Understanding the user's needs was important to creating a system design that was not only functional but also intuitive. I interpreted the client's needs by focusing on the primary pain points, such as students failing their driving tests due to inadequate preparation. This led to the development of features like online practice tests and lesson scheduling. It’s important to consider the user’s needs during design because a system that doesn’t align with their goals and expectations will likely result in poor adoption and dissatisfaction.

When designing software, my approach involves starting with gathering and analyzing requirements from the user to ensure the system aligns with their expectations. I also emphasize the importance of creating UML diagrams to provide a clear, visual representation of the system's structure and workflows. Moving forward, I would continue to use these techniques, but I’d also like to implement more user feedback loops during the design process to make sure the design stays aligned with the user’s evolving needs.
